# infra_needs_analyses
I put here all the data we have received with infrastructure needs results per sector.

I propose we share all our python scripts here for analyzing the datasets

just launch run.bat to open the jupyter notebooks in your browser

wb_api_wraper.py and clustering_and_prim_tools.py are libraries of tools that I use in the notebooks.
